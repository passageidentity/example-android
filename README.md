# Example Android App with Passage Auth
### üîë The easiest way to get passkeys up and running on Android

[Passage](https://passage.id) and the [Passage Android SDK](https://github.com/passageidentity/passage-android) were built to make passkey authentication as fast, simple, and secure as possible. This example Android application is a great place to start. Before using Passage in your own Android app, you can use this example app to:
* Plug in your own Passage app credentials to see passkeys in action
* Learn basic implementation of the Passage Android SDK

A successful registration flow will look like this:
