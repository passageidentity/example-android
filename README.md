# Example Android App with Passage Auth
### üîë The easiest way to get passkeys up and running on Android

[Passage](https://passage.id) and the [Passage Android SDK](https://github.com/passageidentity/passage-android) were built to make passkey authentication as fast, simple, and secure as possible. This example Android application is a great place to start. Before using Passage in your own Android app, you can use this example app to:

* Login/Register with Passkeys: Experience secure and user-friendly passkey authentication.

* Login/Register with One-Time Passcode (OTP): Implement OTP-based authentication for enhanced security.

* Login/Register with Magic Link: Provide users with a seamless login experience using magic links.

* Login/Register with Hosted Login: Utilize hosted login to handle authentication externally.
